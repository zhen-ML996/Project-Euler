'''
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
'''

j = 0
sum = 0
for j in range(1000):
    if j % 3 == 0 or j % 5 == 0 :
        sum = sum + j
        print(sum)
